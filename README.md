This package supports mocking POPOs, it inspects your class properties and populates them with random data generated by Faker. You can create class-based mock factories to have a fluent interface to mock POPOs for different states.

This is a fork of [Data Transfer Object Factory](https://github.com/anteris-dev/data-transfer-object-factory).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require morrislaptop/popo-factory --dev
```

## Usage

```php
use Morrislaptop\PopoFactory\PopoFactory;

class PersonData
{
    public function __construct(
        public $firstName,
        public string $lastName,
        public string $email,
        public string $homeAddress,
        public ?string $companyName,
        public string $workAddress,
        public Carbon $dob,
        public PersonData $spouse,
    ) {
    }
}

PopoFactory::new(PersonData::class)->make();
```

Which creates an object that looks like this:

```json
{
  "firstName": "Jada",
  "lastName": "Bechtelar",
  "email": "edmond.mcglynn@example.org",
  "homeAddress": "640 Feest Landing\nBernierburgh, PA 99277",
  "companyName": "Ratke Inc",
  "workAddress": "75107 Konopelski Radial\nRutherfordport, AK 22994",
  "dob": "2021-01-26T11:04:31.393991Z",
  "spouse": {
    "firstName": "Leola",
    "lastName": "Koss",
    "email": "friedrich41@example.org",
    "homeAddress": "852 Fabian Mills\nNorth Ward, NM 54459",
    "companyName": "Fahey and Sons",
    "workAddress": "671 Creola Prairie Apt. 663\nNorth Gretchenview, OR 75622-4176"
  }
}
```

The `new` method returns an instance of `Morrislaptop\PopoFactory\PopoFactory` which provides the following methods.

- `count()` - _Allows you to specify how many POPOs to be generated. They will be returned in an array._
- `make()` - _Called when you are ready to generate the POPO(s). Returns the generated object(s)._
- `random()` - _Generates a random number of POPOs_
- `sequence()` - _Alternates a specific state. (See below)_
- `state()` - _Manually sets properties based on the array of values passed._

Examples of these methods can be found below.

```php
// Creates two DTOs in an array
PopoFactory::new(PersonData::class)->count(2)->make();

// Sets the first name of every person to "Jim"
PopoFactory::new(PersonData::class)
    ->random()
    ->state([
        'firstName' => 'Jim',
    ])
    ->make();

// Alternates the names of each person between "Jim" and "Susie"
PopoFactory::new(PersonData::class)
    ->random()
    ->sequence(
        [ 'firstName' => 'Jim' ],
        [ 'firstName' => 'Susie' ]
    )
    ->make();

```

## Creating Class Based Factories

It's useful to define specific factories for particular objects, which can easily be done by extending the `PopoFactory` class. 

My specifying a typehint for the `make()` method you will also get typehints in your IDE for your mocked object.

```php
/**
 * @method PersonData make
 */
class PersonDataFactory extends PopoFactory
{
    public static function factory(): static
    {
        return static::new(PersonData::class)->state([
            'firstName' => 'Craig'
        ]);
    }

    public function gotNoJob() {
        return $this->state([
            'companyName' => null,
        ]);
    }

    public function worksAtHome() {
        return $this->state(function ($attributes) {
            return [
                'workAddress' => $attributes['homeAddress']
            ];
        });
    }
}
```

Then using it in tests like so:

```php
$person = PersonDataFactory::factory()
            ->gotNoJob()
            ->worksAtHome()
            ->make();
```


## Extending

You can easily extend the factory to support other data types. You can do this through the static `registerProvider()` method on the `PropertyFactory` class. This method takes two arguments. The first should be the FQDN of the class you are providing (e.g. `Carbon\Carbon`) OR the built-in type (e.g. `string`). The second should be a callback that returns the generated value. This callback is passed two properties when called to assist in generating the value. The first is an instance of `Anteris\FakerMap\FakerMap` which can be used to help generate fake data. The second is an instance of `ReflectionProperty` which contains information about the property being generated.

For example, to support Carbon:

```php

use Morrislaptop\PopoFactory\PropertyFactory;

use Anteris\FakerMap\FakerMap;

PropertyFactory::registerProvider('Carbon\Carbon', fn(FakerMap $fakerMap) => Carbon::parse(
    $fakerMap->closest('dateTime')->fake()
));

```
